# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- Saloon v4 support: upgraded `saloonphp/saloon` to `^4.0` and `saloonphp/laravel-plugin` to `^4.0`
- Generated SDKs now accept both Saloon v3 and v4 (`^3.0|^4.0`)

### Fixed
- Multi-authenticator connectors now correctly use `defaultAuth()` instead of `getAuthenticator()`, consistent with single-authenticator behavior and Saloon's intended override pattern

### Credits
- Thanks to @Sammyjo20 for the Saloon v4 upgrade in PR #40

## [1.4.1] - 2025-11-06

### Changed
- Added Laravel 12 support to illuminate/http dependency constraint

## [1.4.0] - 2025-11-06

### Added
- **Test Generation**: New `--pest` flag to generate Pest PHP test suites for generated SDKs
- `PestTestGenerator`: Automatically generates test files for each resource with proper setup and fixtures
- `ComposerGenerator`: Generates composer.json file with proper dependencies and configuration
- `PostProcessor` contract for extensible post-processing of generated code
- Test stubs for Pest test generation (Pest.php, TestCase.php, resource tests)
- Sample API specifications (Google Drive, Paddle Billing, Paddle OpenAPI)
- Fallback to path-based naming when endpoint has no name in OpenAPI spec
- Generated tests include proper constructor arguments, method parameters, and fixture names

### Changed
- composer.json is now always generated (not just when --pest is enabled)
- Pinned nikic/php-parser to v4.x for compatibility
- Improved endpoint naming fallback strategy

### Fixed
- OpenAPI Reference resolution in parameter schemas - properly resolves Reference objects before accessing type property (fixes #30)
- Test generator parameter handling for path, body, query, and header parameters
- Test generator properly respects ignored query and header parameters
- Test suite configuration now properly excludes generated tests in tests/Output directory
- ArchTest now properly included in test runs
- Removed outdated TODO comment about duplicate DTOs (references work correctly)

### Known Limitations
- Test generator constructor argument handling for nullable parameters is not configurable
- Exception handling in test generator silently returns null (no user feedback)
- Request body type assumptions (JSON for POST/PATCH) are not configurable

## [1.3.1] - 2025-01-05

### Fixed
- Updated dependency constraints to support Laravel 11 and newer termwind versions
- Resolved global installation conflicts with illuminate/http and nunomaduro/termwind

### Changed

- nunomaduro/termwind version constraint updated from `^1.15.1` to `^1.15.1|^2.0`

## [1.3.0] - 2025-01-05

### Added
- Configurable header filtering support with sensible defaults for Saloon-managed headers
- Header parameter support for both OpenAPI and Postman parsers
- Default values for nullable parameters in ResourceGenerator for better developer experience
- Comprehensive tests for deeply nested DTO references
- Tests for nullable parameter default values
- Tests for header filtering functionality

### Fixed
- OpenAPI $ref resolution for parameters and DTOs (fixes #21, #24)
- Parameter references from components section now properly resolved
- DTO generation with nested references using FQN to prevent backslash prefix issues
- Multi-authenticator implementation generating invalid PHP (PR #26)
- SecurityRequirements object handling in OpenApiParser
- Missing namespace use and method params in authenticators

### Changed
- Default ignored headers now include: Authorization, Content-Type, Accept, Accept-Language, User-Agent
- ApiSpecification constructor now has default values for convenience
- Nullable parameters in resource methods now have default values for consistency

### Credits
- Thanks to @nikspyratos for the initial header support implementation in PR #10
- Thanks to @mmachatschek for the nullable parameters fix in PR #27 and multi-authenticator fix in PR #26
